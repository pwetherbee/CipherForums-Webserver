      <p class="title">What is this website?</p>

      <p class="descript">
        This website uses the
        <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_gate"
          >Exclusive Or logic gate (Xor)</a
        >
        to encrypt comments or posts generated by users, using any 256 bit key
        of their choice.
      </p>

      <p class="title">How does Xor work?</p>

      <p class="descript">
        Xor is a simple logic gate that creates a binary output from two binary
        inputs. The two input strings are compared character by character - If
        the two input strings have the same value, a 0 is generated. If the two
        inputs have a different value, a 1 is generated. Below is a descriptive
        graphic by
        <a class="black" href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/">geeksforgeeks.org/</a>
        demonstrating this logic gate.
      </p>

      <p class="title">How does this website use Xor to encrypt content?</p>

      <p class="descript">
        Both messages and keys are contained in 256 bits, or 64 characters. Keys
        utilize the
        <a class="black" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Hash_Algorithms"
          >SHA256 hash function</a
        >
        to get consistent cryptographically secure outputs regaurdless of what
        the user types in. Messages are padded with random letters to make sure
        that their length always equals 64 characters, and are Xored with the 64
        character SHA256 hash of the chosen key. This website styles these
        inputs in the browser, but the content that is used looks like the
        example below.
      </p>

      <div class="indentText">
        <p class="bold">User message:</p>
        <p>Hello, here is an example message.</p>
        <p>-------</p>
        <p class="bold">User key:</p>
        <p>Here is an example key</p>
        <p>-------</p>
        <p class="bold">64 character message with padding letters:</p>
        <p>QPrJSuIcrZRZqzfOIwwZnWwgqOoI|Hello, here is an example message.|</p>
        <p>-------</p>
        <p class="bold">64 character SHA256 hash of key:</p>
        <p>51cc40047e7d5476fcab371037b385a86ce5e64cbe7ebc2a11bb271d8db08558</p>
        <br />
      </div>

      <p class="descript">
        These text values are converted into numbers, and then Xored together to
        produce cipher text. Doing this enables cipher text to be public, and
        only by Xoring it with the key it was generated with will produce the
        origional message.
      </p>

      <p class="title">Who is this website for?</p>

      <p class="descript">
        This website is for people interested in ciphers, secrets, and
        encryption. Users should be aware that the encryption methods used by
        this site are designed to protect information from all common
        individuals, but there are far more secure methods and services for
        people who desire high levels of information security. For individuals
        whose top priority is security, and not the interactivity or
        avaliability of content on this site, it is recommended individuals use
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard"
          >AES Encryption</a
        >, which was developed by the NSA and is military grade.

      <p class="title">*Disclaimer*</p>

      <p class="descript">
        This website is not to be used for criminal activity. This website
        should not be used to store password data, financial data, or any
        sensitive records. While Xor encryption is strong in a vacuum,
        government authorities or advanced cyber security professionals could
        make use of keyloggers, surveillance, inference, endpoint breaches, etc.
        to obtain sensitive information. While these methods do require quite a
        bit of effort, they are not impossible.
