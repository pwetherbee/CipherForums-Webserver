# build node js server
# implement padding in input
#remove end pipe from padding function (I think there is a space added before the pipe)



style:
# add “current key” display next to comment box
# make key input display:fixed; to be able to scroll and use



LONGER
- On the profile view, the forums/comment side boxes should Xor and display either correct or cipher text depending on key
- On the post view, “current key” should display the current key being used next to comment box
- On all pages, make the menu key icon on top right expandable, showing the 3 options with hide/unhide after click (I think JQuery slide or accordion make this easy)
- On the post view add (username / likes / reply) appended to the bottom right of each comment


	Images added to posts
- Make link generation for images that can be xored (when I upload an image, 2 url’s are generated) 
	- 1/2 makes standard size jpg for unexpanded view of image in forum
	- 2/2 makes full size png for full display after clicking standard size jpg





Framework for comments on post - current_key must match forum_key?
 - “DO NOT STORE KEY ON CIPHERFORUMS SERVER” option
	“Users must store keys locally or simply remember them. This provides more security, but does mean other users will be able to comment with any key they choose, and you’re posts may be subject to large amounts of cipher text spam”
